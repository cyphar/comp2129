/*
 * == WARNING ==
 *
 * I've been informed that some current COMP2129 students have been
 * plagiarising the code from this project, and removing the copyright
 * statement to try to hide their plagiarism.
 *
 * These attempts have obviously failed, since you're reading this warning.
 *
 * Aside from being against the University's policies on academic honesty
 * (which can lead to you being severely penalised), it's also outright
 * copyright infringement since the GPL mandates that a full copy of the
 * license and copyright information be included in copies of the work. Not to
 * mention that it's also completely unethical.
